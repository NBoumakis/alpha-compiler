Work by Konstantina Papafragaki, Katerina Lionta, Nikos Boumakis.

To compile, run make in the project folder. The executable is stored in $project_folder/build
and is named 'parser'.

Limitations: Currently does not store the symbols in the symbol table
in the correct order, therefore causing false positives for inaccessible elements.

Run and tested in papaya.csd.uoc.gr
